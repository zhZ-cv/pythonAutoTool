# pythonAutoTool
## This is a python spider project
This project has four files

* AutoWork.py can auto compress some files into a zip, or delete all files in a folder

* BookSeats.py can help you to book library seats

* TsingHuaelt.py is an old version file to finish your boring English Mooc. Maybe it is useless now, but you can update it just by changing some functions

* WHULogin.py is also an old version file to auto login WHU, but you can update it easily. This file has its encryption function

Hope this project is helpful for you!
